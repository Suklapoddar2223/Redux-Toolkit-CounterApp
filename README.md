This is simple counter app to practice basics of redux-toolkit.

I created a repo in github and then a react app folder in local folder.

## react command
For react to install : npx create-react-app my-app->cd my-app->npm start.

## git command
a) create Repository
b) clone repo
c) git init
d) git add .
e) git commit -m ""
f) git remote add origin (copy and paste repository clone)
g) git push origin master/main

The current branch master has no upstream branch.
e as upstream, use

h) git push --set-upstream origin master   

Redux-Toolkit => Action,reducer,store
